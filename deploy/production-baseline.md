# Production/Staging Compose Baseline

This is the production or staging deployment baseline for a single-machine
Docker Compose target. It is separate from `deploy/docker-compose.yml`, which
remains a local/demo integration stack with placeholder credentials and seed
data.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `deploy/docker-compose.production.yml` | Production/staging Compose skeleton. Uses published service images, persistent volumes, migrations, and internal service networking. |
| `deploy/.env.production.example` | Required variable names and safe placeholders. Copy it outside git before filling real values. |
| `deploy/nginx/production.conf` | Public ingress contract. Routes `/api/v1`, `/healthz`, and `/readyz` to gateway and all other browser paths to frontend. |
| `deploy/postgres/init-production/001-create-service-databases.sh` | Empty-volume PostgreSQL initializer that creates service databases and roles from env-injected passwords. |

Do not use `deploy/.env.example`, `deploy/postgres/init/`, or `deploy/seeds/`
for production/staging. Those files are local/demo only.

## Scope

This baseline covers:

- frontend, gateway, auth, file, parser, knowledge, qa, document, ai-gateway;
- a single public ingress that keeps frontend and gateway on one browser origin;
- PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant, and MinIO;
- service migrations before service startup;
- persistent Docker volumes;
- health/readiness checks;
- operator runbook requirements for startup, backup, upgrade, and rollback.

It does not deploy to a real cloud provider, create DNS/TLS certificates, add a
GitHub Actions deploy workflow, or replace the future #125 full cross-service
smoke.

Long-running services use `restart: unless-stopped` so they recover after a
process crash or Docker daemon restart. One-shot initialization and migration
jobs keep `restart: "no"` so failed setup remains visible to operators.

## Image Strategy

Production/staging should run immutable, prebuilt image tags:

```bash
FRONTEND_IMAGE=registry.example.com/software-teamwork/frontend:<git-sha-or-release>
NGINX_IMAGE=nginx:<pinned-alpine-tag>
GATEWAY_IMAGE=registry.example.com/software-teamwork/gateway:<git-sha-or-release>
AUTH_IMAGE=registry.example.com/software-teamwork/auth:<git-sha-or-release>
FILE_IMAGE=registry.example.com/software-teamwork/file:<git-sha-or-release>
PARSER_IMAGE=registry.example.com/software-teamwork/parser:<git-sha-or-release>
KNOWLEDGE_IMAGE=registry.example.com/software-teamwork/knowledge:<git-sha-or-release>
QA_IMAGE=registry.example.com/software-teamwork/qa:<git-sha-or-release>
DOCUMENT_IMAGE=registry.example.com/software-teamwork/document:<git-sha-or-release>
AI_GATEWAY_IMAGE=registry.example.com/software-teamwork/ai-gateway:<git-sha-or-release>
MIGRATE_IMAGE=registry.example.com/software-teamwork/goose-migrate:<git-sha-or-release>
```

Do not use `latest`. Rollback depends on being able to identify the previous
image tags.

The current repository has backend/parser Dockerfiles and no frontend Dockerfile
yet. Before enabling the `frontend` service in a shared environment, publish a
frontend static-server image that listens on port 80 and serves the built SPA.
The Compose `ingress` service is the only public HTTP entrypoint: it proxies
`/api/v1`, `/healthz`, and `/readyz` to `gateway:8080`, and proxies all other
browser paths to `frontend:80`. This preserves the frontend client contract that
browser API calls use same-origin `/api/v1`.

If frontend hosting is terminated outside this Compose stack, keep the same
ingress contract at the external edge: browser `/api/v1/**` traffic must still
route to gateway, and browsers must not call service containers directly.

## First-Time Build Or Pull

First-time image build/pull requires Docker Hub or an enterprise registry mirror
to be reachable for base image metadata and packages. The parser image is the
most sensitive path because it depends on `python:3.12-slim`, Debian packages,
`uv`, Python indexes, and PaddleOCR dependencies.

If `docker compose up --no-build` fails because the parser image is missing,
recover explicitly instead of relying on a developer machine's image cache:

```bash
docker pull "$PARSER_IMAGE"
```

If the parser image must be built locally:

```bash
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build \
  -f services/parser/Dockerfile \
  -t "$PARSER_IMAGE" \
  services/parser
```

For mainland China networks, prefer explicit registry/package rewrites as
documented in `deploy/.env.china.example` and
`docs/runbooks/docker-build-environment.md`. Keep Go checksum verification on;
do not make `GOSUMDB=off` a normal deployment path.

## Environment And Secrets

Prepare a real env file outside version control:

```bash
cp deploy/.env.production.example deploy/.env.production
```

Then replace every `REPLACE_WITH_...` value. Do not commit the filled file.

Required secret classes:

- PostgreSQL admin and per-service database passwords.
- `INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN`.
- `TOKEN_HASH_SECRET` and `TOKEN_HASH_KEY_VERSION`.
- `AI_GATEWAY_SERVICE_TOKEN_HASHES`, derived from allowed internal tokens.
- MinIO root user/password or equivalent S3-compatible credentials.
- `QA_CONFIG_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, a 64-hex-character key.
- `AI_GATEWAY_CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY_REF` and
  `AI_GATEWAY_CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.

Current service database configuration uses PostgreSQL URL strings. Generate
per-service database passwords with URL-safe characters such as letters,
numbers, dot, underscore, tilde, or hyphen. If an operator must use characters
such as `@`, `/`, `#`, or `:`, update both the DSN value and the database role
password deliberately; do not leave an accidentally broken URL in the env file.

Provider API keys are not stored in `.env.production`. Configure them through AI
Gateway model profile/credential APIs after AI Gateway is running. Production
operators should prefer secret references or deployment-environment injection;
the encrypted-column mode is the first-stage repository-supported fallback.

## Static Validation

Before starting containers:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_docker_policy.py
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.production.yml \
  --env-file deploy/.env.production.example \
  config --quiet
```

Validate the filled env file before deployment:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.production.yml \
  --env-file deploy/.env.production \
  config --quiet
```

These checks prove Compose interpolation and policy shape. They do not prove
that placeholder secrets or unpublished images can run.

## Startup Order

Use a release checkout that contains `services/*/migrations`, because the
migration services mount those directories read-only.

The PostgreSQL initializer in `deploy/postgres/init-production/` runs only when
the `postgres_data` volume is empty, following the official PostgreSQL image
contract. Later database password rotation must be performed explicitly with
`ALTER ROLE` or an approved operator procedure; changing `.env.production` alone
does not re-run the initializer on an existing volume.

1. Start infrastructure:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.production.yml \
     --env-file deploy/.env.production \
     up -d postgres redis qdrant minio minio-init
   ```

2. Apply migrations:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.production.yml \
     --env-file deploy/.env.production \
     up migrate-auth migrate-file migrate-knowledge migrate-qa migrate-document migrate-ai-gateway
   ```

3. Start services:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.production.yml \
     --env-file deploy/.env.production \
     up -d auth file parser ai-gateway knowledge qa document gateway frontend ingress
   ```

4. Configure AI Gateway provider credentials and model profiles through the
   admin/profile APIs. QA and Document model-dependent flows require matching
   profile/model IDs in `AI_GATEWAY_PROFILE_ID`, `MODEL_ID`, and
   `DOCUMENT_AI_GATEWAY_PROFILE_ID`.

This baseline intentionally does not create a demo admin user. Bootstrap the
first production administrator through the approved Auth/operator process before
using admin model-profile or settings APIs.

For a compact staging rollout after env and image tags are ready, `up -d` on the
full file is acceptable, but keep the ordered sequence above for first deploys
and incident recovery.

## Readiness Checks

Only `ingress` exposes a host port by default. Frontend, gateway, and internal
service ports stay on the Compose network.

Host checks:

```bash
curl -fsS http://localhost:${INGRESS_HTTP_PORT:-80}/healthz
curl -fsS http://localhost:${INGRESS_HTTP_PORT:-80}/readyz
```

Container-network checks:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.production.yml \
  --env-file deploy/.env.production ps

docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.production.yml \
  --env-file deploy/.env.production logs ingress gateway auth file parser knowledge qa document ai-gateway
```

Service readiness endpoints inside containers:

```text
auth       http://auth:8001/readyz
file       http://file:8082/readyz
parser     http://parser:8087/readyz
knowledge  http://knowledge:8083/readyz
qa         http://qa:8084/readyz
document   http://document:8085/readyz
ai-gateway http://ai-gateway:8086/readyz
gateway    http://gateway:8080/readyz
ingress    http://ingress/readyz
```

`ingress /readyz` delegates to `gateway /readyz`; neither proves external
provider credentials are accepted. Use the AI Gateway provider smoke and the
Gateway -> Knowledge -> QA RAG smoke from `docs/runbooks/local-integration.md`
when provider/profile validation is required.

## Persistence And Backup

| Volume | Data | Backup concern |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `postgres_data` | Auth, File metadata, Knowledge metadata, QA messages/settings, Document jobs, AI Gateway profiles/credentials. | Use `pg_dumpall` or per-database `pg_dump` before upgrades and before irreversible migrations. |
| `redis_data` | Redis AOF for gateway sessions and async queues. | Redis is not the business source of truth, but queue/session loss affects in-flight work. Snapshot before maintenance when feasible. |
| `qdrant_data` | Knowledge vector index. | Use Qdrant snapshot/export procedures or rebuild from Knowledge chunks if an index rebuild is acceptable. |
| `minio_data` | File object bytes and generated document artifacts. | Use MinIO/S3 backup tooling, bucket replication, or `mc mirror`; keep bucket/object data aligned with File metadata backups. |
| `qa_workspace` | QA agent workspace files. | Treat as operational state; back up when active sessions or tool artifacts must survive rollback. |

PostgreSQL is the authority for business state. Redis/asynq is queue/session
runtime state, Qdrant is retrieval index state, and MinIO stores bytes behind
the File Service boundary.

## Upgrade

1. Publish new immutable image tags.
2. Back up PostgreSQL and MinIO before schema or object-format changes.
3. Review migrations. Do not run irreversible migrations automatically without
   an explicit release decision.
4. Update `deploy/.env.production` image tags.
5. Run Compose config validation.
6. Apply migrations.
7. Restart affected services.
8. Run readiness checks and targeted smoke tests.

## Rollback

Minimum rollback path:

1. Keep the previous `.env.production` or record the previous image tags.
2. Repoint image variables to the last known-good tags.
3. Re-run Compose config validation.
4. Start the previous images:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.production.yml \
     --env-file deploy/.env.production \
     up -d
   ```

5. If a migration is not backward-compatible, stop and restore the matching
   PostgreSQL/MinIO backup instead of assuming image rollback is enough.

## Local/Demo Boundary

The local/demo stack still lives in `deploy/docker-compose.yml` and
`deploy/.env.example`. It intentionally includes local placeholders, local admin
seed data, local hashing defaults, and optional fake AI profiles for smoke
testing. Do not promote those values into production/staging.
